## Night at The Museum

Unfortutanelty I was not able to attend N@tM for very long because I had a tennis match that day, however it was still wonderful to see the work of other students. At the event I met someone who was talking CSP. I talked with them for a little bit and they told me about their expereience in the class. I ultimately decided that I would not take CSP next year because I wanted to pursue other fields. I may come back and take more computer science course in the future. In N@tM i observed many games such as the level that my team created as well as another level with a robot in space. I also saw some projects that the older kids had made as well.
