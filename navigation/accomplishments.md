## My Journey This Trimester In Computer science

## Part 1  - Tools

For me getting my tools set up was not an easy task. I remember trying all storts of commands in terminal and nothing was working. I was also falling behind in class because I was sick with the flu. When I came back I was very confused on what to do so I asked my friends and my parents for help. I spent many hours debugging my virtual environment and was finally able to get it to work. Something I learned from this is that success requires hardwork and you will never get anything done if you are always working individually

## Part 2 - game hacks

After getting our tools set up we started working on a game. I chose the calculator game, however for the first few days I was not doing any work and just sitting around. I now realize that, procrastination was a big mistake as I had to work extra hard the last few days to finish my project. I also learned to imporve my communication skills because this project was with a team. I tried my best to help my team debug errors and solve difficult problems.

## Part 3 - Teaching

I taught the lesson on Classes and Methods. I usually am not very good at speaking out-loud so I am proud of my presentation. This was where I encountered lots of failures.  I had to restart all my progress many times becaues of errors and once I even lost my entire lesson. I was very demotivated because 2 days of work vanished right before my eyes, but I knew I needed to keep trying. I learned that failures are completely normal and are not something you should be ashamed of. 

## Part 4  - Game builder

This is where I struggled the most. Making a game from game builder was a very confusing topic for me. In the first few days of this project I was facing many hurdles. To me, making a succesful game seemed like an impossible task. Eveyrthing was looking dim when our group hand barely madae any progress. Only 1 day before the deadline, our group was able to make a functioning game. Our game was very barebones but it still worked. From this I learned that I should keep a positive mindset and encourage myself instead of telling myself that we will never finish in time.
